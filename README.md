Prototype of Nordic Network:
Free Hosting Service

In total 64 GB RAM will be available the first month;
- 32 GB RAM in USA
- 32 GB RAM in UK


You can now *test* the program by following these instructions:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Clone this repository to your computer.
2.  Go to Nordic-Network/private/servers/0 and add the Minecraft server
jar in there. Make sure it's named minecraft_server.jar, it can actually
be any jar and not only Minecraft but it must have that name *for now*
:)
3.  Go to your terminal, type in "cd
path/to/github/projects/Nordic-Network/private" (use "\" instead of "/"
if on Windows) and after that type in "node controlpanel-server". **Make
sure node.js AND required libraries are installed.**
4.  Start your browser and go to "localhost:15015", press Inspect Element
and click on "Console". Then type in "startServer(0, "01234569abcdef");"
and press enter. The server will now start on your computer **locally**, and remember this is only for testing the program. In the future you'll just need to enter the website to start your server and it will be up online :)
